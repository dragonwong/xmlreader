			<explanation><![CDATA[Status Epilepticus: Ongoing seizure activity is injurious to the brain and can cause other organ system problems like pneumonia and sudden death.  Making an accurate diagnosis is essential as is the orderly institution of anticonvulsant drugs to terminate the seizure activity.  
This protocol gives a practical, step-by-step guide to how status epilepticus can be terminated.<br>

			<explanation><![CDATA[If the patient is still convulsing despite benzodiazepines, phenytoin or valproate loading, and then third line agents described in the prior step, the patient will need more aggressive intervention.  The patient should at least be intubated and transferring to an ICU at this point.  Once in the ICU, establish good blood pressure monitoring, then begin pentobarbital. Give:
<li>Pentobarbital: Load: 5 mg/kg IV up to 50 mg/min; repeat 5 mg/kg boluses until seizures stop; Initial rate: 1 mg/kg/hour;  Maintenance: 0.5-10 mg/kg/hour traditionally titrated to suppression-burst on EEG but titrating to seizure suppression is reasonable as well</li><li> Continuous EEG monitoring is essential; if not available in your center consider transfer to a regional center with this capability.</li>
Comments:
<li>Hypotension is frequently encountered as a side effects of pentobarbital and pressors should be readily available. Other side effects include gastric stasis, myocardial suppression, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis (68-75% propylene glycol).</li>
<li>Often this step will be done in ICU setting but at times with patients that are highly refractory pentobarbital infusions may need to be started while in the ER and within the first hour of status epilepticus onset.</li><li>The duration of continuous IV antiepileptic medications used for Boxes #5 and #6 is unclear. Once seizures are controlled, many physicians continue treatment for at least 24 hours prior to consideration of wean. The rapidity of weaning is also controversial but should not be done too abruptly unless pentobarbital is used where this is less of an issue. The goal of pentobarbital therapy is unclear (seizure control, burst suppression, or completely suppressed background)?</li><li>The antiepileptic agent is controversial. Choices include but are not limited to ketamine (which should be used in combination with a benzodiazepine), lacosamide, levetiracetam, and hypothermia to 33 degrees Celsius.</li>]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Start second line anticonvulsant.  Choose one of the following:
<li>Fosphenytoin: load 20 mg/kg IV at up to 150 mg/min</li>- OR -<li>Valproic acid: load: 40 mg/kg IV over 10 min (may give additional 20 mg/kg over 5 min if still seizing)</li>
Arrange for EEG monitoring if available.
If status epilepticus persists despite starting second line anticonvulsants, intubate the patient, then choose one of the following:
<li>Continuous infusions of midazolam: Load: 0.2 mg/kg IV over 2-5 min; repeat 0.2-0.4 mg/kg boluses every 5 minutes until seizures stop, up to a maximum loading dose of 2 mg/kg. Initial rate: 0.1 mg/kg/h. Bolus and increase rate until seizure control; Maintenance: 0.05-2.9 mg/kg/hour</li><li>Continuous infusions of propofol: Load: 1-2 mg/kg IV over 3-5 min; repeat boluses every 3-5 minutes until seizures stop, up to maximum total loading dose of 10 mg/kg. Initial rate: 33 microgram/kg/min (2 mg/kg/hr). Bolus and increase rate until seizure control;  Maintenance: 17 - 250 microgram/kg/min (1-15 mg/kg/hour)</li><li>Valproic acid (if not chosen already as second line agent): 40 mg/kg IV over 10 min (may give additional 20 mg/kg over 5 min if still seizing)</li><li>Phenobarbital:  Load: 20 mg/kg IV up to 60 mg/min;  Maintenance: 1-3 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses</li>
Comments:
<li>Titrate AEDs to therapeutic levels. When checking post-load drug levels, wait at least 2 hours post infusion for fosphenytoin and phenytoin, or immediately post infusion of valproate</li>
<li>Continue second line antiepileptic medication when starting treatment of refractory status epilepticus.</li><li>Phenobarbital has been used traditionally for status epilepticus refractory to first and second line therapy but recently experts recommend more rapid advancement to continuous IV antiepileptic medications.</li><li>What should the target for continuous drips be: seizure control, burst suppression, or completely suppressed background?</li><li>Definition of refractory status epilepticus is unclear. Some controversy regarding duration of time and number of agents that patients have to have failed exists.</li>]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[And the patient is following commands]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[The half-life of benzodiazepines is brief and therefore a longer-lasting anticonvulsant needs to be administered to prevent subsequent seizures.
Give:
<li>Fosphenytoin: load 20 mg/kg IV at up to 150 mg/min</li>- OR -<li>Valproic acid: load: 40 mg/kg IV over 10 min (may give additional 20 mg/kg over 5 min if still seizing)</li>
If possible connect to EEG unless patient wakes up or returns to pre-convulsive baseline.
Determine the cause of the seizure (prior history of seizures and medication non-compliance, new onset seizure, etc.)  Serum levels of anticonvulsants are useful to determine what threshold the patient with epilepsy has for developing seizures.  Urine toxicology screen may be helpful for recreational drug-associated seizures.]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Have the seizures stopped or the patient began following commands]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[Status epilepticus is terminated when the patient begins to follow simple commands.  Even if the convulsions have stopped the patient may still be seizing.  If the patient does not rapidly awaken following the administration of the first line anticonvulsants, one should consider the patient to still be seizing.]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[The diagnosis of status epilepticus]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[The clinical definition of status epilepticus is five minutes or more of convulsions or two or more convulsions in a 5 minute interval without return to preconvulsive neurological baseline.  However, a patient may be seen to seize, then brought into the hospital and not regain consciousness.  This too may be status epilepticus and usually requires EEG measurement to diagnose.<br>
Traditional definition of status epilepticus required 30 minutes to have passed. Do not wait for 30 minutes to pass before starting antiepileptic medications since permanent brain injury may occur before 30 minutes have elapsed and most seizures that do not progress to status will be shorter than 5 minutes.]]></explanation>
