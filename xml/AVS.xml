			<explanation><![CDATA[Management of the airway, how to ventilate and if needed sedate a patient with suspected or known neurological injury requires skill and understanding of the underlying issues of cerebral herniation, elevated ICP and neuromuscular status surrounding chemical paralysis.  
This topic will provide an organized approach to assessing and establishing an airway, the initial ventilator settings and suggest methods to sedate an agitated patient in whom you may not fully know the cause of their neurological condition.
In cases of suspected elevated ICP (coma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI, hydrocephalus, etc.):
<li>Rapid sequence intubation is the preferred method of securing the airway in patients with suspected elevated ICP since it provides protection against the reflex responses to laryngoscopy and rises in ICP. The presence of coma should not be interpreted as an indication to proceed without pharmacological agents, or to administer only a neuromuscular blocking agent without a sedative/induction drug. Although the patient may seem unresponsive, laryngoscopy and intubation will provoke reflexes that elevate ICP unless appropriate pretreatment and induction agents are used.</li><li>Outcomes in patients with intracranial catastrophes are related to the maintenance of both brain perfusion and oxygenation; consequently, close assessment and management of these two parameters is critical. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the driving force for blood flow to the brain, and is measured by the difference between the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and the ICP: CPP = MAP - ICP. Clinical evidence of increased ICP include altered mental status plus unilaterally dilated pupil, bilaterally dilated and fixed pupils, and decerebrate posturing (N.B. decorticate posturing is not predictive of elevated ICP). It is generally recommended that the ICP be maintained below 20 mmHg, the MAP between 100-110 mmHg, and the CPP near 70 mmHg. It is generally recommended that the ICP be maintained below 20 mmHg, the MAP between 100-110 mmHg, and the CPP near 70 mmHg.</li><li>Problems associated with elevated ICP may be compounded by many of the techniques and drugs used in airway management since they may cause further elevations of intracranial pressure. In addition, victims of multiple trauma may present with hypotension, thus limiting the choice of agents and techniques available.</li>

			<body><![CDATA[Sedation and analgesia principles]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[<li>Assure patient comfort with analgesics</li><li>Heavy sedation is employed ONLY for control of ICP, safety concerns including transport, or cerebral metabolic failure requiring control of CMRO2</li><li>Light sedation, using short acting agents only</li><li>Minimal or NO sedation is preferred when above concerns are absent</li><li>DO NOT allow medication-induced hypotension</li>
The goal of analgesia and sedation in the neurocritically ill is typically to maintain comfort with minimal disruption of the neurological examination, ventilator weaning, and rehabilitation activity.  Many short-acting sedatives have prolonged activity when continuously infused, and neurointensivists often choose short acting analgesic infusions that can be discontinued for neurological examination, supplemented with boluses of short or intermediate acting sedatives.
Occasionally, ICP crisis, status epilepticus, or other neurological crises require a state of deep, continuous sedation.  This is often achieved by high dose infusions of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  High dose propofol ( >80mcg/kg/min) must be avoided due to the dose-dependent risk of Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS).]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Critically ill patients are at risk of airway compromise; consequently, early management of these patients must include an assessment of their airway regarding ease of intubation and ease of bag mask ventilation. This assessment enables strategic planning and efficient resource utilization. 

The "LEMON" pneumonic helps to predict the difficult airway: <li>L= look</li><li> E = evaluate the mouth opening and airway position</li><li>M = Mallenpati score</li<li>O = obstruction</li><li>N= neck mobility. 

The "MOANS" pneumonic predicts ease of bag mask ventilation. 
<li>M = Mask seal not good, e.g. beard, facial deformity, etc.</li><li>O = Obesity (difficult ventilate), 3rd trimester pregnancy, or obstruction e.g. neck swelling, angioedema, hematomas, cancer, etc.</li><li>A = Age, elderly, loss of muscle tone to support the upper airway</li><li>N = No teeth (no teach causing caved in face)</li><li>S = Stiff lungs - upper airway obstruction - exacerbation of asthma, COPD, etc.</li>
Patients who are deemed to be difficult should alert the clinician to the need for appropriate back-up either in terms of skills (call anesthesia) or devices (set up the flexible fiberoptic intubating device and set-up for a cricothyrodiotomy).

Assessment of ease of bag mask ventilation is critical and if deemed difficult mandates access to an intrapharyngeal ventilation device, e.g., LMA.]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[The affordability and proven benefit new generation intubation devices have established a new standard in airway management. To have only direct laryngoscopy fails
to meet the expect standard of care in managing critical patients. The success of direct laryngoscopy is dependent on patient anatomy, the ability to hyperextend the patient's neck and create an alignment of the visual axis. In trauma, direct laryngoscopy may be impeded by cervical immobilization, bleeding, and or anatomic distortion. Consequently, airway management in critical environments requires that an assortment of airway devices be available; at a minimum, a optical enhancement device, and an intrapharyngeal ventilation system, e.g., LMA, should be available.]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Failure to oxygenate, ventilate, protect airway or anticipate deterioration]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[There are four commonly accepted indications to intubate a patient.:<li>Failure to oxygenate is generally driven by pulse oximetry though the clinician is reminded of its limitations, e.g., hypoperfusion, severe anemia, opaque nail polish. </li><li>Capnometry provides a monitor for ventilation though it too has its limitations in trauma and does not always correlate with PCO2, however it does provide a valuable tool for monitoring trends in the patient's ventilatory status. </li><li>Ability to protect the airway is fundamental to minimizing risk of aspiration and its complications; this is best assessed by observing the patient's ability to spontaneously swallow or to swallow after suctioning. </li><li>A gag reflex is an inaccurate method of assessing airway protection, however, if this is used it is best done with a suction catheter and not a tongue blade. </li>
Anticipated course of the patient's airway status is the most inexact of the of the indicators to intubate a patient and requires that multiple factors be taken into consideration including location of the patient and resources available.]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Management of the critically ill patient is generally provided by a team of physicians, nurses, and assistants with each team member doing their intervention simultaneously with the other team members. Placing the patients on monitors provides the baseline physiologic information needed in decision making. In addition, from the onset, any patient who may require intubation should receive 100% oxygen via non-rebreather face mask in order to maximize nitrogen washout and maximize oxygenation; this will minimize desaturation during intubation.]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Rapid sequence intubation is the preferred method of securing the airway in patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), since it provides protection against the reflex responses to laryngoscopy and rises in ICP.  Keep the Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (Mean arterial pressure - ICP) between 80-100 mmHg throughout the process.  If ICP is not known, assume an ICP of 20 mmHg.]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Consider these induction medications]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[At time intubation minus 3 minutes give:<li>Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg AND Fentanyl/remifentanyl 3 ug/kg over 30 sec</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR<li>Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg AND Esmolol 1-2 mg/kg</li>
When the airway is manipulated there are two responses that result in increased ICP: there is a reflex sympathetic response (RSR) which results in increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and consequent increased ICP; in addition, there is a direct laryngeal reflex the stimulates an increase in ICP independent of the RSR. In the management of patients who are suspected of having an increased ICP, elevations in the ICP should be mitigated by minimizing airway manipulation, i.e., the most experienced person should perform the intubation, and pharmacologically using medications. The three commonly used pre-medications are lidocaine, fentanyl, and esmolol.
<li>Lidocaine&#39;s primary benefit is on attenuating the direct laryngeal reflex. There is mixed evidence that it actually mitigates the RSR. </li><li>The short acting beta blocker, esmolol does control both heart rate and blood pressure responses to intubation. A dose of 2 mg / kg given three minutes before intubation has been shown to be effective. Unfortunately, in the emergency situation, the administration of a beta blocking agent, even one that is short acting, may be problematic. Although esmolol is consistent and reliable for
mitigation of RSRL in elective anesthesia, it is generally not used for this purpose in the ED. </li><li>Fentanyl at doses of 2 - 3 micro-g/Kg attenuates the RSR associated with intubation. Although a full sympathetic blocking dose of fentanyl is 9 to 13 micro-g/kg, the recommended dose of fentanyl for RSI in emergency patients is 2-3 micro-g/kg and should be administered as a single pretreatment dose over 30 to 60 seconds in order to reduce chances of apnea or hypoventilation before induction and paralysis. Fentanyl should not be administered to patients with incipient or actual hypotension, or those who are dependent on sympathetic drive to maintain an adequate blood pressure for cerebral perfusion.</li>]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Induction and paralysis]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[Give:<li>Etomidate 0.3 mg/kg or Propofol 1.5 mg/kg</li><li>Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg</li>
Induction should be performed using an agent that will not adversely affect CPP. Etomidate is a short-acting imidazole derivative that is the most hemodynamically stable of all commonly used induction agents. Its ability to decrease CMRO2 and ICP in a manner analogous to that of sodium thiopental and its remarkable hemodynamic stability make it the drug of choice for patients with elevated ICP. Propofol is an alternative.

Thiopental confers some cerebroprotective effect via decreasing the basal metabolic rate of oxygen utilization of the brain (CMRO2); it also decreases cerebral blood flow, thus decreasing ICP. However, thiopental is a potent venodilator and negative inotrope thus it has a tendency to cause hypotension and reduce CPP, even in relatively hemodynamically stable patients.

In the past, Ketamine was generally avoided in patients with known elevations in ICP as it was believed it could elevate the ICP further. Recent evidence has disputed this viewpoint. However, in hypotensive patients, ketamine's superior hemodynamic stability may argue for its use.

Either a depolarizing or a nondepolarizing agent can be used to paralyze the patient after induction. Succinylcholine (SCh) remains the drug of choice for management of patients with elevated ICP because of its rapid onset and short duration. Though it has been associated with transient increases in ICP, this is not considered significant and therefore not a contraindication to its use. Premedicating with a defasiculating dose of a nondepolarizing agent is no longer considered worthwhile. An alternative would be to use a competitive neuromuscular blocking agent. Rocuronium is the competitive agent most suited to this strategy due to its rapid onset and consistent achievement of intubating conditions.]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Initial volume cycled ventilation parameters:<li>Tidal Volume 8 cc/kg (ideal body weight)</li><li>Respiratory rate: match pre-sedation spontaneous respiratory rate, or set to 12 breaths per minute</li><li>Inspired fraction of oxygen: 1.0; titrate rapidly to lowest FiO2 that will maintain SpO2 at 95-99%</li><li>Start capnometry monitoring (ETCO2)</li><li>Pulse oximetry</li>
This applies to several neurological emergencies, including:<li>Traumatic brain injury</li><li>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</li><li>Large intracerebral hemorrhage</li><li>Ischemic stroke with airway compromise or coma</li><li>Hydrocephalus</li><li>Intracranial tumor with depressed mental status</li><li>Suspected high ICP and depressed mental status</li><li>Diffuse cerebral edema</li><li>Status epilepticus</li>
Goals of mechanical ventilation: 
Mechanical ventilation must be carefully titrated to maintain physiological homeostasis.  Because pCO2 is the most potent acute mediator of cerebral vascular tone and cerebral blood flow, great caution must be used when performing ventilation.  Over ventilation to a low pCO2 and high pH may cause decreased cerebral blood flow, worsening brain ischemia, and sometimes causing seizures.  Under ventilation to a high pCO2 may cause cerebral vasodilation and lead to ICP crisis.  Both very low (pO2 &lt; 60mmHg) and very high (pO2 &gt; 300mm Hg) have been strongly linked to poor outcome in TBI and in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest.
Rarely, clinicians are forced to employ ventilatory techniques to manage intracranial catastrophes, such as purposeful hyperventilation to acutely decrease intracranial pressure in a patient with acute brain herniation.  Such techniques should be performed for the minimum possible time, however, with the goals of substituting more durable means of decreasing ICP, and restoring ventilatory homeostasis as soon as possible.]]></explanation>
