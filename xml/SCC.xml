			<explanation><![CDATA[Acute signs and symptoms of myelopathy:<li>Bilateral numbness or weakness that is present at a specific dermatomal level and continues caudally</li><li>Weakness is of upper motor neuron variety (spastic, extensors effected more than flexors, up-going toes)</li><li>Urine retention or spastic bladder</li><li>May have focal back pain identified via percussion of the spine</li>Acute spinal cord compression is an emergency so work-up and intervention should begin immediately.
If there is severe back pain and leg weakness consider aortic dissection as a cause; typically such patients will have intact joint position sense in the toes but loss of temperature sensation along with marked weakness (anterior spinal artery syndrome).
If the patient is taking anticoagulants, and emergent workup for coagulopathy is warranted.  See <a href="#/ICH/Coagulopathy" target="_blank"><font color='#0000AA'>reversal of coagulopathy</font></a>.
See <a href="#/ANTW" target="_blank">Approach to acute weakness</a>&nbsp;for a more formal evaluation of the cause of weakness.

<li>Use of steroids is controversial; discuss with your consultant</li>
<li>Spinal cord decompression is possible but often not done emergently to give time to observe a response to antibiotics.  Document the neurological exam (primarily strength testing) well to establish a good baseline from which to make this decision.</li>]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Cervical myelopathy may affect diaphragm]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[Assess ventilatory functions (ABG, simple inspection, EtCO2) and consider airway protection and mechanical ventilation.  A bedside Forced Vital Capacity is helpful if available (intubate for FVC &lt; 1 L); having the patient count out loud as fast as possible is also a good screen (normals should be able to exceed 20-30 count).<br>
<li>Patients with total body weakness (unable to move the face and arms and legs) either has a generalized neuromuscular disorder, or perhaps a stroke of the brainstem (locked in).  Secure the airway first then pursue the <a href="#/ANTW" target="_blank">Acute Weakness </a>protocol, or <a href="#/AIS" target="_blank">Acute Ischemic Stroke</a>.</li><br>Once ventilation has been assessed, move on to acute imaging, but for those patients who are not intubated, anticipate progression of weakness and ensure continuous monitoring of ventilation as the work-up continues.]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Imaging is used to rule out any compressive etiology of the spinal cord like tumor, infection, or intervertebral disc herniation.  It is important to communicate the neurological findings to your radiologist so that the proper location(s) of relevance are imaged.  <br><li>Quadriplegic patients should have the C-Spine imaged.  Entire spine imaging (including the conus) may also be appropriate especially if the patient has known cancer.</li><li>Paraplegic patients (if there are no symptoms in the arms) should have both the T-spine and LS spine imaged.  Reflexes are likely unreliable in this context in guiding whether to include T-spine imaging; i.e. rapid compression of the T-spine can cause hyporeflexia in the lower extremities acutely, so an areflexic paraplegia is not necessarily a cauda equina syndrome (which localizes to the LS spine on imaging).  </li><br>A discussion with the radiologist is important to image the proper level, and to expedite the imaging so that treatments can be provided efficiently and quickly.<br><br>
It is also important to notify a spine surgeon at this point to alert them that your patient may have a myelopathy that will need surgical decompression, and when their spine imaging will be completed.]]></explanation>

			<body><![CDATA[Based on what is seen on MRI]]></body>
			<explanation><![CDATA[Imaging may reveal no evidence of cord compression.  If so, other causes of myelopathy need to be considered including transverse myelitis, spinal cord infarction, viral myelitis (West Nile, CMV, HIV, HTLV-1), dural AV fistula, and others.  Refer to the  <a href="#/ANTW" target="_blank">acute non-traumatic weakness protocol</a> for a discussion of these entities, and especially consider  <a href="#/ANTW/AorticDissection" target="_blank">aortic dissection with spinal infarction</a>.<br><br>Spine imaging may reveal several compressive etiologies, including:<br><li><u>Metastatic disease</u>: metastatic disease to the spine is not an uncommon presentation of some cancers.  There is usually spinal tenderness over the regions involved.  Treatment with high dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hr by 23 hours) can help shrink tumor edema and maintain cord health until surgical decompression is available.  STAT involvement of a spine surgeon and radiation oncology is imperative, and facilitation of transfer elsewhere if none is available.</li><li><u>Spinal hemorrhage</u>: spontaneous epidural bleeding is uncommon but may present in patients without coagulopathy and no other predisposing conditions.  Treatment may involve surgical decompression.  STAT involvement of a spine surgeon is imperative, and facilitation of transfer elsewhere if none is available.  If there is a coagulopathy present, following the <a href="#/ICH/Coagulopathy" target="_blank">protocol on coagulopathy</a>.</li><li><u>Acute disk herniation</u>: disk herniation that compresses the spinal cord or the cauda equine may represent a neurosurgical emergency.  Treat with methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hr by 23 hours, and STAT involvement of a spine surgeon is imperative, and facilitation of transfer elsewhere if none is available.</li><li><u>Epidural abscess</u>: pus in the epidural space likely causes myelopathy by venous infarction rather than actual cord compression but the clinical signs and symptoms are identical.  STAT involvement of a spine surgeon is imperative, and facilitation of transfer elsewhere if none is available.  Draw blood cultures, look for signs of endocarditis, perform a 12-lead ECG (to look for PR prolongation), and consider starting empirical antibiotics in consultation with the surgeon and perhaps infectious disease consultant.   Anti-microbial coverage should include staphylococcus, streptococcus, and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If there is a history of a recent neurosurgical procedure, coverage for gram negative organisms should be added.</li>]]></explanation>

			<explanation><![CDATA[Patients with evidence of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, intravenous (IV) drug use, or a known infectious source should be started on empiric antibiotics after blood cultures are drawn. Anti-microbial coverage should include staphylococcus, streptococcus, and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If there is a history of a recent neurosurgical procedure, coverage for gram negative organisms should be added. These empiric therapies may be coordinated with the accepting facility's physicians.]]></explanation>

<li>Consult radiation oncology to consider emergent spinal irradiation</li>

<li>Pain management: short acting narcotics, consider airway issues if the process is cervical</li>
<li>DVT prophylaxis: no heparin yet until surgical decision is complete; pneumatic compression stockings are appropriate</li>
<li>If the neoplastic process is leptomeningeal (i.e. not directly compressing the cord but encasing the cord), decompression is likely not necessary but spinal fluid assessment is the next step.  Consult oncology and consider LP</li>]]></explanation>
