			"explanation": "<u>Meningitis and Encephalitis:</u> Patients that have a hyper-acute (hours) and acute (hours to days) onset of headache and altered mental status, should be considered as potentially having meningitis or encephalitis.  Additional symptoms including stiff neck (to flex/extend), fever, new rash, focal neurological finds or new onset seizures, should significantly increase the clinical suspicion of CNS infection.\nAs with all acute medical and neurological events, the basics of ABC (airway, breathing and circulation) should be evaluated early in the Emergency Department course.  Patients with altered mental status are at high risk for losing a patent airway and should be monitored closely for the potential of needing intubation.  Likewise, patients with bacterial meningitis are at risk for lung or bloodstream infections with the same pathogen, and as such, vital signs and hemodynamics need to be monitored closely.\nMeningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges while encephalitis is defined as inflammation of the brain.  If both are inflamed, the patient has meningoencephalitis.  Meningitis causes fever, meningismus, and pain (headache, neck, etc.) but other than depressing a patient&#39;s mental status, does not affect any cortical function.  Encephalitis on the other hand causes typically cortical disturbances (seizures, aphasia, hemiparesis, etc.).  In pure encephalitis, the spinal fluid is free of white cells but protein may be elevated.  Once white cells are found in the spinal fluid, some form of meningitis is present.  \nThe two conditions that are most important to recognize in the first hour are bacterial meningitis and herpes encephalitis as these diseases have specific treatments that can improve patient outcome if administered quickly.\n<i>Topic Co-Chairs:</i><br>David Gaieski, MD<br>Bart Nathan, MD<br>"

			"explanation": "Time of onset is when the patient was last seen normal.<li>If they can say when the first symptoms began, use that time</li><li>if an observer can say when they saw the symptoms begin (excluding wake up), use that time</li><li>If a patient awakens with a stroke, the time of onset is when they last went to bed</li>The time of onset is critical for using t-PA as the risk of intracerebral bleeding increases with increased time from stroke onset.  If you cannot establish the time with certainty, most physicians will not treat with t-PA.Advanced imaging techniques may be used to chose appropriate candidates for treatment beyond the 4.5 hour time window; such off-label use of t-PA is institutionally specific."
