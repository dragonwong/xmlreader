However, that means that you can miss 5 out of 100 patients with CT alone.  If the patient&#39;s complaints suggest SAH, you are obligated to perform a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of subarachnoid blood products (Class 1, LOE B). \nThe LP is done to look for xanthochromia.  Xanthochromia is the staining of CSF by heme breakdown products (chiefly bilirubin) by ependymal xanthene oxidase.  It takes several hours for blood in the subarachnoid space to break down, so the presence or absence of xanthochromia is time dependent.\n<li>If the CSF shows xanthochromia, the diagnosis of SAH is confirmed (be careful if the CSF protein exceeds 100 mg/dL as this can be a false positive).<\/li><li>If the CSF is clear of RBCs and xanthochromia is absent, it is highly unlikely that the patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  However, a rapidly expanding aneurysm without subarachnoid rupture can present with a classic headache, so if you still suspect an aneurysm on clinical grounds, emergent consultation is suggested.<\/li><li>If the CSF shows RBCs in the 1st and 4th tube of equal amounts, and the LP was done in the first few hours of the onset of headache, SAH is likely.<\/li>\nStated otherwise, the typical findings of SAH on spinal fluid analysis are:<li>RBCs<\/li><li>&lt; 5 WBCs<\/li><li>WBC:RBC ratio 1:700<\/li><li>Xanthochromia is present<\/li><li>Minimal clearing of RBCs between tubes 1 and 4.<\/li>\nAtypical or inconclusive findings:<li>Clearing of RBCs from tube 1 to 4 (perhaps because the spinal needle caused venous bleeding on the way in: traumatic tap)<\/li><li>RBCs present in similar number in Tubes 1 and 4 but the LP was done within the first 4 hours of the headache (could be SAH or traumatic tap)<\/li><li>Xanthochromia is absent, and the LP was done more than 12 hours following the onset of headache (bleed was too small to produce much xanthochromia)<\/li><li>Excessive WBCs (ratio WBC:RBC &gt; 1:700) suggesting meningitis or encephalitis<\/li>\nNote:<li>The sensitivity of all tests for SAH are dependent upon the time from the bleed.
