The onset is usually sudden and many patients progress over a few hours likely due to continuing intracerebral bleeding.  It is not possible to be certain whether the stroke is due to hemorrhage or ischemia based on signs and symptoms alone, so some form of brain imaging is necessary.\n<i>Topic Co-Chairs:<\/i><br>J.
